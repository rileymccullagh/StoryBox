# StoryBox

A storytime tool for my baby cousin

## The Idea
My grandmother, when my mother and uncles were young, recorded herself reading children's books on a boombox and would play back the tapes for the kids. This is a reincarnation of the same idea.

## The Enclosure
I used wood from an old cabinet thrown out by a church around the corner from where my cousin is growing up. I built a dovetailed box (with fairly green dovetailing skills) and used abalone caught on a camping trip we took to inlay it with her initials.

## The Electronics
The box is run by an Arduino Pro Mini talking to a Teensy 3.2, with audio running from the teensy audio board to an LM386 based amplifier circuit.
